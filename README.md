Slides for my Intro to Ocaml talk I gave at [Local Hack Day](http://localhackday.mlh.io/schedule.html) 
for Major League Hacking.  The video has not been posted yet.  Also, I am 
not currently hosting these slides but will eventually. For now, if you'd 
like to view the slides, follow the [reveal.js "full setup" install](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/#installation) 
but with this repo cloned instead of the reveal.js repo.
